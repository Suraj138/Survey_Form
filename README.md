## 🧐 Abstract <a name = "abstract"></a>
we have created a survey form page that includes input elements for name, email, age, gender, and feedback, as well as a submit button. We have also added some basic styling to make the page look more visually appealing. You can customize the CSS properties to match the  design you have in mind.
